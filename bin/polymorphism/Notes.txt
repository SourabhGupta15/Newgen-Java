If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Method Overloading :
    Multiple methods can have same name with different parameters.
    The me must have different parameter types, number of parameters or both.
    Overloading can occur for both static and instance methods.

Method Overriding :
    It occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementaion of a method already defined in its superclass.
    Same Method Signature : The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type (or a covariant return type), and parameter list 


Object is the parent class of all classes.
When a member of a class is called, flow starts from child class and flows upward to parent classes to check for a member.

@Override annotation for method overriding. It is optional. But it is best practice.
