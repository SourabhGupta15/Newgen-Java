Static variable :
    It can only be declared globally that is in the class but outside the method and even main method.
    eg. static datatype variableName;

Static Block :
    In Java, Static block is executed before main method at the time of class loading.
    eg. static{

        }
    
Static Method :
    If we apply static keyword on any method then that method is known as Static method.
    Static method can be called without creating the instance of the object class.
    It can be invoked directly on the class. For example, ClassName.methodName()
    eg. static datatype methodName(){

        }

Static Nested Class :
    A static nested class cannot directly access non-static members of the enclosing class.
    We can access non-static members of the enclosing class by passing an enclosing class instance to a static nested class method.

this Keyword :
    It is used to invoke current class instance variable, method and constructor.
    For variable: this.variableName
    For method : this.methodName()
    For constructor : this()
    If this keyword is not used then compiler automatically adds this keyword while invoking the instance variable, method and constructor during compile time.
