Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Ways to achieve Abstraction
    1. Using Abstract Class (0 to 100%)
    2. using Interface (100%)

Abstract Class in Java :
    A class that is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java.
    It can have abstract and non-abstract methods(method with the body).

    1. An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
    2. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
    3. It cannot be instantiated.
    4. It can have constructors and static methods also.
    5. It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.


Abstract Method in Java :
    A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.
    An abstract method is only allowed in an abstract class or an interface.


Key Features of Abstract Classes :
    1. Abstract Methods :
        Abstract Classes can have abstract methods which are declared without a body.
        Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for these methods.
    
    2. Concrete Methods :
        Abstract classes can also contain concrete methods with defined behavior.
        Subclasses inherit these methods along with their implementations.

    3. Cannot instantiated :
        Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.
        They serve as blueprint for other classes and must be extended to be used.

Interface :
    The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
    There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body.
    It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

    1. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
    2. It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.
    3. Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.
    4. Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.

We use interface to achieve 100% abstraction.
Non-abstract methods are methods with body.
