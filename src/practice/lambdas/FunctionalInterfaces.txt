Java provides many predefined functional interfaces that we can use to perform common tasks.
These interfaces are defined in java.util.function package.

There are four types of functional interfaces defined in this package :
    > Consumer :
        It represents an operation that takes single argument and returns no result.
        It consumes a value.
        void consume(obj)

    > Supplier :
        It represents an operation that takes no input and returns a value.
        It supplies a value.
        obj supply()

    > Function :
        It represents a function that can map a value to different value.
        obj map(obj)

    > Predicate:
        It represents an operation that takes an object and checks to see if an object satisfies some criteria. We use this in filtering data.
        For eg. with the predicate interface we can get the customers who don't have a phone number or filter courses that are older than 2 years.
        bool test(condition)
