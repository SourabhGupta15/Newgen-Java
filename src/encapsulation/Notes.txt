Java Package :
    Package in Java can be categorized in two form : built-in package and user-defined package.
    There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql, etc.

    Advantage of Java Package :
        Java package is used to categorizethe classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.
        Java package provides access protection.
        Java package removes naming collision.

Encapsulation :
    Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
    For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
    
    A Java class is the example of encapsulation.
    Every class in Java is encapsulated.

    A fully encapsulated Java class is in which all the data members are private.
    Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.

    
    We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
    And then we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

    Advantage of Encapsulation in Java :
        It provides you the control over the data.
            Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside the setter method.
            You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter methods.

        It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
        E.g. :
            public class Student {

                //private data member
                private String name;

                //getter method for name
                public String getName() {
                    return name;
                }

                //setter method for name
                public void setName (String name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }
            }

    
    Read-Only Class :
        public class Student {
            
            //private data member
            private String college = "AKG";

            //getter method for college
            public String getCollege() {
                return college;
            }
        }
